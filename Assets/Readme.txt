Space Invaders - Coding Test
----------------------------

The goal of the test is to develop a space invaders game. 
There are some basic elements created for you to build on.

Key goals:
1) Develop a Space Invaders game. 
--- It should have at least one wave of enemies.
--- You should derive from BaseSpaceInvaders, and replace the script on the 'Game' object with your own.
2) If you have time, maintain and display a list of high-scores, which persists between runs of the game.
3) If you have remaining time, improve the game further in any way you think is most appropriate given your skills and the time remaining.

Please email your project back to jobs@pixeltoys.com at the end of the test.

Tips to play the game
1. Use the arrow keys or A/D keys to move the player.
2. Use space bar to fire enemies.
3. Cover behind shield to evade fire and shields can break after some hits
4. Enable the endless game bool in DemoSpaceInvader to have an endless game till the player dies.
